## Description

Demo application (REST API) to interact with the chaincode deployed on Hyperledger Fabric blockchain.

## Quickstart

Make sure you have installed the project dependencies and generated the `.env` configuration file as
described in the main repository [README](../../README.md) file. Then run the next command:

```bash
$ npm start
```

Now you can interact with the chaincode using the REST API provided listening on port 3000.

Once the application is running, open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:3000/explorer`
to see the OpenApi specification.
